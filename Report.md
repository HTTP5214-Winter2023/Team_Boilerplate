I spent this week working on setting up the Trello group that will be used going forward to record our weekly tasks. The group is linked below. We talked about making a boilerplate template with html, CSS, and JavaScript code that, when entered into PowerShell, instantly generates files for each of the aforementioned. You can modify this basic code to suit your own requirements. We made the decision to conduct more research on this and present our findings at the meeting the following week. I established a team repository in addition to my own.

This week, we began by talking about our research, which was the boilerplate code from the previous week. Then, a PowerShell script was made available along with a boilerplate template for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also worked on modifying the boilerplate and tailoring it to my requirements. Then, as a team, we convened to consider additional modifications that may be made to this boilerplate. My GitHub branch has the original boilerplate template. As the scrum master, I also asked each team member if they had any specific concerns they wanted to address or if there was a subject they wanted us to study as a group (No one had anything specific to talk about).

This week, my team and I discussed ways to further enhance and adapt the boilerplate template we used the week before, as well as what we planned to construct for the remainder of the semester. The next step is to create an API for ChatGpt and possibly test it to make sure it functions properly.
Here is the website for the project: (For this day, no link was made.
