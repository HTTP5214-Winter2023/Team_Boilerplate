# Linda Badurina's Report - Final Version
## ***(Finalized April 21, 2023)***
____

## ***January 18, 2023***

### **Individual Work:**   
Re-familiarized myself with Trello so that I’m ready when it comes to using it for project management and 
keeping track of tasks when working in a group. 
Practiced using the platform to ensure I fully understood.

Blocked from much further progress until I am able to join a group. 

### **Meeting Info:**   
Had not yet joined a group, so left meeting information out of personal report. 

____

## ***January 25, 2023***

### **Individual Work:**   
Spent some time figuring out what the different group options meant, and what type of work I might be 
doing based on the group I decide to join. Did not join a group yet.

Blocked from much further progress until I am able to join a group. Plans to intend in-person did not pan out. 

### **Meeting Info:**   
Had not yet joined a group. No information that makes sense for a personal report to put here. 

____

## ***February 01, 2023*** 

### **Individual Work:**   
Joined Team Boilerplate. Reached out to my group on Discord, hoping to establish communication. 

Spent some time familiarizing myself with what exactly a boilerplate is, when it could come in handy, and 
what creating one could look like.

Currently blocked from further progress until I am able to establish communication with my team.

### **Meeting Info:**   
Was awaiting communication. Left team meeting information out of personal report for that reason. 

____

## ***February 08, 2023***

### **Individual Work:**   
Established communication and became a member of the What’s App group. 

Joined the corresponding Trello board.
Checked out the team’s GitHub repository. 

No immediate reason to have progress blocked.

We talked about what we researched and distributed a powershell script with a template for
the boilerplate.

The plan is to edit the boilerplate and personalize it.

### **Individual Work:**   
Jointly determined that we would be putting the power of ChatGPT to use, and working with it to have it 
help us create custom boilerplates, where users can direct our program which customization to use before 
spitting out the useable code.

Used this week to familiarize myself with ChatGPT and it’s capabilities.

This week’s progress blocker is the difficulty that arrises due to not being able to participate in meetings 
in-person. Sometime’s reaching out on What’s App does not work (I attempted to ask to be included remotely, 
but they likely did not see the message on time - understandably so!).

We talked about what we are going to build for the rest of the semester. We updated a powershell script with a 
template for the boilerplate.

The plan is to build API for ChatGPT and If we finish early we are going to do testing.

____

## ***March 01, 2023 (Reading Week)***

Reading week. No meetings, no progress to report.

____

## ***March 08, 2023*** 

### **Individual Work:**   
Created my own boilerplate using ChatGPT’s guidance.
However, later realized that there was a big misunderstanding on my end regarding the project. Code was 
scrapped. 

Misunderstanding likely arises due to difficulties with attending in-person sessions. This leaves too much 
room for miscommunication or lost information. This unfortunately continues to be somewhat of a progress 
blocker, but not one that completelpely derails my ability to contribute in at least some way at this time.

This week, we researched using the OpenAi API for chatGPT and how we would integrated it to our project. We 
found a couple of scripts online that made use of python. We also layed out a contigency plan, which was to make use 
of our original .ps1 script, moodify that, creaate a repo with a descriptive read me so that when it comes to user 
testing, we would have something to distribute. We split the group into 2. 1 group will focus on the integreation 
aspect while the other gorup would focus on the contingency plan. The goal for next week is that for the integration 
team, they carry on reaserching how to integrate the API and come with whatever work they do and the contingency team 
can have a demo page created and can start working on the read me.

## ***March 22, 2023***     

### **Individual Work:**     
Absent due to illness.
Brainstormed ideas for how I can meaningfully contribute to this project, but no physical work was accomplished. 

This week’s primary progress blocker is my illness.

### **Meeting Info:**    
Not included in this individual report due to being MIA for illness.

____

## ***March 29, 2023*** 

### **Invidual Work:**      
Continued absence on the day of class due to ongoing illness, but got myself back on track later the same week.

Soon after class day, connected with team members through What’s App for some quick catch-up (on my end) and 
next steps. 

Determined that I would be adding finishing touches to the project through the use of HTML/CSS. While the project 
functioned great, it had little to no styling or formatting. 

I began the HTML/CSS, and was able to complete some minor styling. 

Nothing blocking progress (beyond the first couple days of the week which were lost due to illness).

### **Meeting Info:**     
Not included here due to being away for illness when meeting took place.

____

## ***April 05, 2023*** 

### **Invididual Work:**    
Continued the “beautifying” of the project. Cleaned up the UI and adjusted proportions of the visual elements. 
Added more options to the boilerplate, giving users more customization opportunities.
Added colouring, typography, form styling, and established a user-friendly layout that met modern web design 
standards.

Sent screenshot to showcase progress to group chat to ensure that they were up to date.

Nothing currently blocking progress.

This week, we summaried and made conclusion of the usability test. Optimized the applicatioin. Worked on 
personal stand-up logs.

____

## ***April 12, 2023*** 

### **Individual Work:**    
Wrapped up the visual styling of the project and pushed the code to GitHub. Initially had some difficulties with this, 
but figured it out with the help of my team. 

Led this week’s stand-up session and took notes. Concluded the project. Added this information to GitHub by updating 
the team's standup log.

Nothing currently blocking progress.

This week we focused on finishing touches to conclude the project.

We clarified that the development for the application was mainly at the end, but agreed that adding a final 
touch in regards to the aesthetics of the product would be beneficial.

The goal for the following week (or next hour!) will be to ensure Linda's HTML/CSS design changes are correctly 
added to the GitHub repository. This will ensure three things, including:

1. That the final application is not only functionally useable, but also easy eye-catching and inviting to users
User friendly due to being designed with critical UX design principles in mind
2. That the application is responsive, therefore useable on any screen size
3. If time permits, additional functionality can also be added giving user's more customization options for personalizing 
their boilerplate (currently there are two). The required changes for this have already been added in the HTML/CSS, but 
they are not yet functional.

These changes will ensure that the application meets all the user's needs in as many ways possible and goes slightly beyond 
the requirements of a MVP.

Thus, ends our project!

### **Individual Work:**     
Worked on wrapping up my personal log. Transferred from messy, handwritten scribbles to clean digital copy. Adjusted 
formatting. Fixed grammar. Clarified information where needed and removed some word vomit. Added to GitHub. 

Begin praying that I added this to the correct location.

No more progress to be blocked (ta da!).

### **Meeting Info:**.     
Not applicable. Meetings concluded last week.
