## Feb 8th

Work

We started our powershell code to distribut our works. By adding the script in our HTML/CSS/Javascript
pages, other people can retrieve our works. We started by creating a homepage for Boilerplate. We used the
code to get a template first and then redesigned it by our own versions.
