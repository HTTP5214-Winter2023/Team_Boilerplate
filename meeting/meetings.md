We chose to use Whatsapp for our communicaiton

Do you want to use voice chat or type only?

I think we can create some code template that included the HTML, CSS, and javascript. And in the html, the header, footer, nav, and aside are fully programmed with id/class. We can add a list or flex box to the content and picture, also the button or form.

This week, we researched using the OpenAi API for chatGPT and how we would integrated it to our project. We found a couple of scripts online that made use of python.
We also layed out a contigency plan, which was to make use of our original .ps1 script, moodify that, creaate a repo with a descriptive read me so that when it comes to user testing, we would have something to distribute. 
We split the group into 2. 1 group will focus on the integreation aspect while the other gorup would focus on the contingency plan. 
The goal for next week is that for the integration team, they carry on reaserching how to integrate the API and come with whatever work they do and the contingency team can have a demo page created and can start working on the read me.

This week, we worked on integrating ChatGPT into our page. Finally we successfully integrate a ChatGPT template by using python. Besides, we also found another template for Node.js. If we successfully integrate it, we can generate HTML/CSS template for any pages. Then, we discussed how to make use of the templates to build our boilerplate webpage. Apart from the ChatGPT, we were also making a boilerplate webpage using HTML/CSS.

Our goal next week is to finish our boilerplate webpage and ask our classmates to user test our page.
