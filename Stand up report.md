Work
•	This week I worked on creating a Trello group for our team which is linked below and will be used moving forward in documenting our weekly tasks.  We discussed creating A boilerplate template that included a html, CSS and JavaScript code that once entered to the PowerShell automatically creates files for each of the aforementioned. This starter code can also be edited to fit individual needs. We decided to do further research on this and bring forth our ideas in the following week’s meeting. I created my own repository and a team repository.

Work
•	This week we started off by discussing what we have researched which was the boilerplate code from last week. A PowerShell script was then distributed with a template boilerplate that creates a html, CSS, and JavaScript. I also practiced editing the boiler plate and personalizing it to suit my needs. We then came together as a team to brainstorm other ways this boilerplate can be customized. The original boilerplate template is in my GitHub branch. As the scrum master, I also checked with each of the team members to see if there was anything specific they would like to address or if there was a specific topic they want us to do research on as a team (No one had anything specific to talk about).

Work
•	This week I worked on brainstorming with my team members on what we plan to build for the rest of the semester and how to also improve / customize the boiler plate template further we used in the previous week. The plan moving forward is to build API for ChatGpt and potentially test this API to ensure if it works properly.
