Work
•	This week I worked on creating a Trello group for our team which is linked below and will be used moving forward in documenting our weekly tasks.  We discussed creating A boilerplate template that included a html, CSS and JavaScript code that once entered to the PowerShell automatically creates files for each of the aforementioned. This starter code can also be edited to fit individual needs. We decided to do further research on this and bring forth our ideas in the following week’s meeting. I created my own repository and a team repository.

Work
•	This week we started off by discussing what we have researched which was the boilerplate code from last week. A PowerShell script was then distributed with a template boilerplate that creates a html, CSS, and JavaScript. I also practiced editing the boiler plate and personalizing it to suit my needs. We then came together as a team to brainstorm other ways this boilerplate can be customized. The original boilerplate template is in my GitHub branch. As the scrum master, I also checked with each of the team members to see if there was anything specific they would like to address or if there was a specific topic they want us to do research on as a team (No one had anything specific to talk about).

Work
•	This week I worked on brainstorming with my team members on what we plan to build for the rest of the semester and how to also improve / customize the boiler plate template further we used in the previous week. The plan moving forward is to build API for ChatGpt and potentially test this API to ensure if it works properly.

Meeting
SCRUM MASTER: Nikhil Sarker Note taker: Stephen Folorunsho

My team and I did research on how to use the openAi API for chatGPT and how this can be used to achieve the end goal of our projects. We did some research and scripts that used python to implement this. We made a contigency plan, which was to make use of our original .ps1 script, do some modifications to it, create a repo with a detailed read me to make things easier for participants during usability testing. We split the group into 2. A group focused on the integration aspect while the other group focused on the contingency plan. The goal for next week is for the first team to continue their research regarding the ChatGPT API and provide a substantial code that works so the second team has a page that they can then use to develop the read me page.

Meeting
SCRUM MASTER: Ka Wing Chan Note taker: Ka Wing Chan
We worked on integrating ChatGPT into our boilerplate script/ page. We were able to then integrate a ChatGPT template by using python. My group and I also found another template for Node.js. The script can be used to generate HTML/CSS template for any websites of ones choice. To conclude the meeting, we discussed how to make use of the templates to build our boilerplate webpage.

Our goal next week is to finish our boilerplate webpage and ask our classmates to user test our page.

Meeting 
We carried out the usability testing of our boilerplate script with 5 participants from our class. After they used the script, each participant completed a questionnaire which consisted of their likes and dislikes of the project and their feedback on how to improve the website. We compiled the findings generated from each participant and will include it in the final report.
