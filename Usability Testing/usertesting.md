- Scenario:
 You are a software development company that has developed a code boilerplate generator using ChatGPT's language model. You want to test the functionality and effectiveness of the program by allowing users to generate code for a simple website.

- Participants:
    5 Web development students from the class
     1. Vita 
     2. Simon
     3. Louise
     4. Ceci

- Instructions: 

    - Before the testing session:

        - Explain the purpose of the code boilderplate chatbot to the participant and provide them with some background information
        - Explain how the chatbot works and what kinds of questions it can answer
        - Ask the participant to think of some questions they would like to ask the chatbot
       </br>
    - During the testing session:

        - Start the chatbot program and allow the participant to interact with it
        - Encourage the participant to ask any questions they have about the topic
        - Take note of any issues or errors that occur during the conversation
        - Ask the participant to provide feedback on their experience using the chatbot

      </br>       
    -  After the testing session:

        - Ask the participant to complete a short survey or questionnaire about their experience
        - Ask them to rate the chatbot on various aspects such as functionality, user interface, content, user experience, accessibility, and security
        - Ask them to provide specific examples of what they liked or disliked about the chatbot



- Script 

    - Before the testing session:
    > "Hello and thank you for using our code template generator using ChatGPT and NodeJs. The purpose of this tool is to provide you with a customizable template for desired website (shoe store, book store, flower shop e.t.c.). Do you have any questions before we begin?"



    - During the testing session:
    >"Please feel to specify the type of website you needs. You can modify the code structure, after copying it into your code editor to fit your needs. We want to see how well the template can be adapted to different use cases."



    - After the testing session:
    >"Thank you for using our code template generator. We appreciate your feedback. Please take a moment to complete a short survey about your experience. We want to know how well the template worked for you and what we can do to improve it."





  - Steps:

1. Open the boilerplate website produced by ChatGPT
2. Read the instructions and purpose of the testing provided
3. Check if all the required libraries and dependencies are installed
4. Run boilerplate app by typing what kind of website you need.
5. Input the required fields such as programming language, framework, database, etc. 
6. Check if the generated HTML, CSS code meets the requirements and specifications
7. Try modifying some parameters or settings and see how the code is affected
8. Note any issues or errors that occur during the conversation
9. Provide feedback on your experience using the chatbot and completing the survey provided after the testing session.

Likes / Dislikes / Recommendations: There are different types of feedback you could collect from your users, and if you would prefer to use, say, a System Usability Scale, that's totally fine. The bare minimum format for collecting user feedback is to ask for their likes, their dislikes and their recommendations.

- participant 1: Vita

Likes:
- The codes that provided a simple template with styles and menu bar. That allows me to build my own webpage easier.
- The style of elements' composition is okay.

Dislikes:
- couldn't see the loading state

Recommendations:
- will be great if the codes can be placed in VScode automatically OR adding a 'COPY' button

- participant 2: Simon

Likes: I like that it works!! Nicely done. I like how simple the design is, and how the form submission worked by pressing Enter (not just pressing the button). I like the little dog. And I like that the mis-spelling of 'Boilterplate' was consistent throughout. I like that it gave me code to copy and that it took my suggestion and totally worked as intended!

Dislikes: 'Boilterplate', no feedback after I hit 'Enter' (I thought it wasn't working). The code it generates is maybe... too boilerplate=y? It's missing several things that every HTML page should have. For example, [here's a good boilerplate](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/). 

Recommendations: A 'copy code' button should be pretty easy to implement!

- participant 3: Louise

Likes: I like that it's stratight forward. As soon as you open the website, it shows what exactly I need to do. There's no unnecessary information or features that complicates the page. It feels like a one-stop shop. The colours are also amazing and refreshing to the eyes. The automated code in itself is also really good as a foundation for me, this lessend the time of coding especially if I have assignments and projects all at the same time. 

Dislikes: When it was "loading" there wasn't an indicator of it's loading or not. Because the loading time take a while not having an indicator that it's loading is confusing to me. 

Recommendations:  
- maybe a loading graphic or just a word that says "please wait" something like that

- participant 3: Ceci

Likes: so cool that ChatGpt gets you the right color, right data for the navigation bar

Dislikes: there is no loading status while waiting the template to generate, there is no formatting and no tag for the HTML and CSS

Recommendations: Maybe more styles to choose like the navigation bar styles, can have a copy button for copying automatically, can seperate the HTML and CSS instead of inline tag style
