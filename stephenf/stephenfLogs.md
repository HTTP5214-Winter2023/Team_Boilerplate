## Jan 18th

Last time, I worked on coming up with pain points in web development and what I can automate. I decided to look into creating a powershell script that will open up a boilerplate HTML in VS code.

Today, I'm going to work on using Trello and navigating the Kanban board.

Here's a list of stuff that's blocking me from moving ahead with my work:
Understing Git and GitHub.

## Meeting
This week we decided our groups. I chose team boilerplate. 
SCRUM MASTER: Stephen Folorunsho
Note taker: Wenbo Min
Meeting type: Sprint planning

In the meeting, I delegated the roles of note taking to Wenbo. We also chose to use Whatsapp as our main form of communicaiton.
In this meeting we broke down the end goal into small tasks in order to create an HTML, CSS and JS boilerplate including having, the header, footer, nav, aside, fully programmed with id/class, including content and pictures.

## Work
I made use of chatGPT and asked it to write me a powershell script that would open Visual Studio Code with a HTML and CSS boilerplate template. through trial and error and asking the chat multiple prompts, I was able to achieve my desired goal.

## Work
This week we created our GitHub repository for us to place all our work on there and a kanban board, where we put each task we needed to compete for our assignment. Then I created my own branch in the repo for me to place any other work I completed. 

I then looked into modifying the script from lastweek so that it created a new folder with a random name using chatGPT and also to add a JS boilerplate to the template.

Meeting type:  Sprint review
link to script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HTTP5214-Winter2023/Team_Boilerplate/main/scripts/starterscript.ps1

We distributed a template script. We update the trello board and moved what we was completed into the done section and what are doing into the doing section. 
The goal for next week is that everyone can edit/play with the script template to personalize it to suit them. 

## Work
I did not work much on the template last week, but the goal is that everyone should have a version of theirs.

## Meeting
SCRUM MASTER: Gahee Choi
Note taker: Gahee Choi
Meeting type: Product owner check-in
link: https://lablab.ai/tech/chatgpt#boilerplates

Based on the Trello board, we have pretty much all the tasks completed. We then had a meeting the Simon(the product-owner). 
From tha meeting, we dicussed that we can make use of chatGPT's API to create a web page where anyone can ask it to generate a HTML, CSS and JS boilerplate with their desired specifiation and then they would be able to see the result and just copy that into their VS Code.

## Work
I looked into reading chatGPT's documentation for it's API and how we would be able to use it for our purpose. I saw that there is a Google chrome extension and I will continue to look into how to create this.

This week, we researched using the OpenAi API for chatGPT and how we would integrated it to our project. We found a couple of scripts online that made use of python. We also layed out a contigency plan, which was to make use of our original .ps1 script, modify that, create a repo with a descriptive read me so that when it comes to user testing, we would have something to distribute. We split the group into 2. 1 group will focus on the integreation aspect while the other gorup would focus on the contingency plan. The goal for next week is that for the integration team, they carry on reaserching how to integrate the API and come with whatever work they do and the contingency team can have a demo page created and can start working on the read me.
I created an OpenAI Key, installed pythonand worked on the making the phyton script work. I was able to get it running. I followed the document I found on it and although I ran into some errors, I was able to get it running. I also reach out the Simon, and he sent me a python script that allows a user to use chatGPT in the command line, which could be another option for out group. I will present my findings to the group next week.

## Meeting
SCRUM MASTER: Ka Wing Chan
Note taker: Ka Wing Chan
This week, we worked on integrating ChatGPT into our page. Finally we successfully integrate a ChatGPT template by using python. Besides, we also found another template for Node.js. If we successfully integrate it, we can generate HTML/CSS template for any pages. Then, we discussed how to make use of the templates to build our boilerplate webpage. Apart from the ChatGPT, we were also making a boilerplate webpage using HTML/CSS.

Our goal next week is to finish our boilerplate webpage and ask our classmates to user test our page.


## March 22

This week, as a group we performed our usability testing in class with 5 participants from the class. We had a script that was used and each participant filled out a qustionnarie answering questions such aas what they liked, what they disliked and what recommendations they have to improve our site. We compilled all of our findings in our repo and will submit it in our report. 
Next week, I will work on making usre I have all ther rquired filles and documnets required to pass the course.
