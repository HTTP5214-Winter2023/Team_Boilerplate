## Individual Log / Report - Final Version

## Jan 18th

Re-amiliarized myself with Trello so that I’m ready when it comes to using it for project management and 
keeping track of tasks when working in a group. 
Practiced using the platform to ensure I fully understood.

Blocked from much further progress until I am able to join a group. 

## Jan 25th

Spent some time figuring out what the different group options meant, and what type of work I might be 
doing based on the group I decide to join. Did not join a group yet.

Blocked from much further progress until I am able to join a group. Plans to intend in-person did not pan out. 

## Feb 1st

Joined Team Boilerplate. Reached out to my group on Discord, hoping to establish communication. 
Spent some time familiarizing myself with what exactly a boilerplate is, when it could come in handy, and 
what creating one could look like.

Currently blocked from further progress until I am able to establish communication with my team.

## Feb 8th

Established communication and became a member of the What’s App group. 
Joined the corresponding Trello board.
Checked out the team’s GitHub repository. 

No immediate reason to have progress blocked.

## Feb 15th

Jointly determined that we would be putting the power of ChatGPT to use, and working with it to have it 
help us create custom boilerplates, where users can direct our program which customization to use before 
spitting out the useable code.
Used this week to familiarize myself with ChatGPT and it’s capabilities.

This week’s progress blocker is the difficulty that arrises due to not being able to participate in meetings 
in-person. Sometime’s reaching out on What’s App does not work (I attempted to ask to be included remotely, 
but they likely did not see the message on time - understandably so!).

## Mar 1st

Reading week. No progress to report.

## Mar 8th

Created my own boilerplate using ChatGPT’s guidance.
However, later realized that there was a big misunderstanding on my end regarding the project. Code was 
scrapped. 

Misunderstanding likely arises due to difficulties with attending in-person sessions. This leaves too much 
room for miscommunication or lost information. This unfortunately continues to be somewhat of a progress 
blocker, but not one that completelpely derails my ability to contribute in at least some way at this time.

## Mar 22nd

Absent due to illness.
Brainstormed ideas for how I can meaningfully contribute to this project, but no physical work was accomplished. 

This week’s primary progress blocker is my illness.

## Mar 29th

Continued absence on the day of class due to ongoing illness, but got myself back on track later the same week.

Soon after class day, connected with team members through What’s App for some quick catch-up (on my end) and 
next steps. 

Determined that I would be adding finishing touches to the project through the use of HTML/CSS. While the project 
functioned great, it had little to no styling or formatting. 
I began the HTML/CSS, and was able to complete some minor styling. 

Nothing blocking progress (beyond the first couple days of the week which were lost due to illness).

## Apr 5th

Continued the “beautifying” of the project. Cleaned up the UI and adjusted proportions of the visual elements. 
Added more options to the boilerplate, giving users more customization opportunities.
Added colouring, typography, form styling, and established a user-friendly layout that met modern web design 
standards.
Sent screenshot to showcase progress to group chat to ensure that they were up to date.

Nothing currently blocking progress.

## Apr 12th

Wrapped up the visual styling of the project and pushed the code to GitHub. Initially had some difficulties with this, 
but figured it out with the help of my team. 
Led this week’s stand-up session and took notes. Concluded the project. Added this information to GitHub.

Nothing currently blocking progress.

## Apr 19th

Worked on wrapping up my personal log. Transferred from messy, handwritten scribbles to clean digital copy. Adjusted 
formatting. Fixed grammar. Clarified information where needed and removed some word vomit. Added to GitHub. 
Begin praying that I added it to the correct location.

No more progress to be blocked (ta da!).
