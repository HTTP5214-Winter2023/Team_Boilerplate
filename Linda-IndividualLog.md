# Linda Badurina - Individual Log
## ***Finalized: April 21st, 2023***
**Link to longer **"Final Report"** including team meeting notes can be found here:**    

https://github.com/HTTP5214-Winter2023/Team_Boilerplate/blob/Linda/Linda-FinalReport.md
    
**Confused about why there's two seperate files for these notes? Me too! But here's a "Pro Tip":**  

Want to read less? Don't need to see the same group meeting notes again? Stay here! 

**Explanation:**      

The file you are currently reading only contains my **personal** log! Please see the above link if you'd 
rather see this combined with weekly team meeting notes. However, this one is much shorter if you'd rather
avoid the redudancy (and extra scrolling) of reading the same weekly meeting notes for the 10th time :)

I have only linked to the "Final Report" to cover my bases in case that was actually the preferred format
for the final submission.

## *January 18, 2023*

### Personal Contributions / Progress:
Re-familiarized myself with Trello so that I’m ready when it comes to using it for project management and 
keeping track of tasks when working in a group. 
Practiced using the platform to ensure I fully understood.

### Progress Blockers:
Blocked from much further progress until I am able to join a group. 

_____ 

## *January 25, 2023*

### Personal Contributions / Progress:
Spent some time figuring out what the different group options meant, and what type of work I might be 
doing based on the group I decide to join. Did not join a group yet.

### Progress Blockers:
Blocked from much further progress until I am able to join a group. Plans to intend in-person did not pan out.

## *February 01, 2023*

### Personal Contributions / Progress:
Joined Team Boilerplate. Reached out to my group on Discord, hoping to establish communication. 

Spent some time familiarizing myself with what exactly a boilerplate is, when it could come in handy, and 
what creating one could look like.

### Progress Blockers:
Currently blocked from further progress until I am able to establish communication with my team.

_____ 

## *February 08, 2023*

### Personal Contributions / Progress:
Established communication and became a member of the What’s App group. 

Joined the corresponding Trello board.
Checked out the team’s GitHub repository. 

### Progress Blockers:
No immediate reason to have progress blocked.

## *February 15, 2023*

### Personal Contributions / Progress:
Jointly determined that we would be putting the power of ChatGPT to use, and working with it to have it 
help us create custom boilerplates, where users can direct our program which customization to use before 
spitting out the useable code.

Used this week to familiarize myself with ChatGPT and it’s capabilities.

### Progress Blockers:
This week’s progress blocker is the difficulty that arrises due to not being able to participate in meetings 
in-person. Sometime’s reaching out on What’s App does not work (I attempted to ask to be included remotely, 
but they likely did not see the message on time - understandably so!).

## *March 01, 2023 (Reading Week)*

Reading week. No meetings, no progress to report.

_____ 

## *March 08, 2023*

### Personal Contributions / Progress:
Created my own boilerplate using ChatGPT’s guidance.
However, later realized that there was a big misunderstanding on my end regarding the project. Code was 
scrapped. 

### Progress Blockers:
Misunderstanding likely arises due to difficulties with attending in-person sessions. This leaves too much 
room for miscommunication or lost information. This unfortunately continues to be somewhat of a progress 
blocker, but not one that completelpely derails my ability to contribute in at least some way at this time.

_____ 

## *March 22, 2023*

### Personal Contributions / Progress:
Absent due to illness.
Brainstormed ideas for how I can meaningfully contribute to this project, but no physical work was accomplished. 

### Progress Blockers:
This week’s primary progress blocker is my illness.

_____ 

## *March 29, 2023*

### Personal Contributions / Progress:
Continued absence on the day of class due to ongoing illness, but got myself back on track later the same 
week.

Soon after class day, connected with team members through What’s App for some quick catch-up (on my end)
and next steps. 

Determined that I would be adding finishing touches to the project through the use of HTML/CSS. While the 
project functioned great, it had little to no styling or formatting. 

I began the HTML/CSS, and was able to complete some minor styling. 

### Progress Blockers:
Nothing blocking progress (beyond the first couple days of the week which were lost due to illness).

_____ 

## *April 05, 2023*

### Personal Contributions / Progress:
Continued the “beautifying” of the project. Cleaned up the UI and adjusted proportions of the visual elements. 
Added more options to the boilerplate, giving users more customization opportunities.
Added colouring, typography, form styling, and established a user-friendly layout that met modern web design 
standards.

Sent screenshot to showcase progress to group chat to ensure that they were up to date.

### Progress Blockers:
Nothing currently blocking progress.

_____ 

## *April 12, 2023*

### Personal Contributions / Progress:
Wrapped up the visual styling of the project and pushed the code to GitHub. Initially had some difficulties with 
this, but figured it out with the help of my team. 

Led this week’s stand-up session and took notes. Concluded the project. Added this information to GitHub by 
updating the team's standup log.

### Progress Blockers:
Nothing currently blocking progress.

_____ 

## *April 19, 2023*

### Personal Contributions / Progress:
Worked on wrapping up my personal log. Transferred from messy, handwritten scribbles to clean digital copy. 
Adjusted formatting. Fixed grammar. Clarified information where needed and removed some word vomit. Added to 
GitHub. 

Begin praying that I added this to the correct location.

### Progress Blockers:
No more progress to be blocked ***(ta da!)***.
